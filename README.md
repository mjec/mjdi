A collection of MIDI stuff, for me to play around with.

`brandenburg.mid` is a public domain MIDI file of JS Bach's Brandenburg Concerto #2 in F (1st movement).
The file is used for tests, and was downloaded from the [University of Arizona School of Music MIDI database](http://midi.music.arizona.edu/purpose.php).

Believe me, I wish that test file were canyon.mid, but I doubt I have permission to redistribute that.
